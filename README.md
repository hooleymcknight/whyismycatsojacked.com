a display of all my pets!

This project was started on November 12th, 2022. It's absolutely a work in progress.

Things I'd like to add:
* image carousel on the pet pages...maybe, I'm still deciding how I feel about carousels in general
* a forum for people to submit images of their own cats
* a redesign more focused on the actual tank cat, Christopher. Right now the site is an even spread of all the pets
